My five websites are:
1) google.com

Pros:
- Simple, easily accessible. 
- Layout is straightforward, with easy access to other Google services.
- Attention to even the smallest of details, such as updating the webpage during special events.
- Loads quicky.

Cons:
- Possibly too minimalistic. Other than the Google logo, there's no actual color or warmth.

Future Updates:
Make it more fun! Make it programmable, having users being able to modify what they want could be an interesting update. 

2) apple.com

Pros:
- User interaction is engaging and well done.
- Layout for products is straightfoward.
- Purchasing section is also well done.
- Loads quickly.

Cons:
- Sometimes visuals for a product seem to be interactive, although they are not.

Future Updates:
Apple has done a lot of work on their website, and most of everything seems to be super clean. Other than visuals being more interactive, I can't really think of much.

3) microsoft.com

Pros:
- Layout is organized, all products are accessible.
- Clean, simplistic, with a bit of color here and there.

Cons:
- The visuals aren't dynamic, even with the main page.
- Too many things per page?

Future Updates:
Unlike Apple, Microsoft has less of a *wow* factor. Maybe with removing some content in the homepage, and making it more flashy, Microsoft's website could take a turn.

4) youtube.com

Pros:
- Clean, usually shows subscriptions so easy to find videos which I like.
- Addictive.
- Integration to Google services are very well done.
- Good videos! Life changing.

Cons:
- Youtube algorithm doesn't benefit early to medium youtubers.
- Organization could be cleaner, maybe without all the subscriptions on the side.
- Youtube could be made to save things without WiFi.

Future Updates:
Youtube is revolutionary. Generally it's great to use, but I think experimenting with the user interatction and also the recommendation algorithms would both benefit creators and consumers.

5) wikipedia.com

Pros:
- Source of tons of information, layout is generally easy to use.
- Information is user based, which is sometimes great, sometimes not, but generally authentic. People can provide many perspectives.

Cons:
- OUTDATED graphics. Definitely needs a modern upgrade, with a similar layout to minimize confusion among long time users.

Future Updates:
Wikipedia is a great open source resource, but I believe that the graphics should be updated for cleaner and more enjoyable information.
